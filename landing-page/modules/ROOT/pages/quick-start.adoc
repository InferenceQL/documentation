= InferenceQL: Quickstart
Ulli Schaechtle <u.schaechtle@gmail.com>

== Overview

This is a quickstart guide to help you use the IQL auto-modeling project to build your own
models on tabular data and query them. This guide starts with building a model from an example dataset.

== Installation

=== Dependencies

We rely on the Nix package manager. Please find instructions to install it https://nixos.org/download.html[here]. Nix takes
care of all our dependencies. However, on Windows, you also need to https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install[install WSL].

=== Download Auto-modeling

If you are installing from a zipfile
[source,bash]
----
unzip InferenceQL.v0.zip
----
If you are installing from gity
[source,bash]
----
git clone git@github.com:OpenIQL/inferenceql.auto-modeling.git InferenceQL
----

=== Start the Nix shell

To install modeling capabilities, go to the auto-modeling directory:
[source,bash]
----
cd InferenceQL
----
and install the dependencies by running:
[source,bash]
----
nix-shell
----

=== Running auto-modeling:
Add a csv file:
[source,bash]
----
cp ~/foo/mydat.csv data/data.csv
----
Modify the `params.yaml` file as needed. And build default models:
[source,bash]
----
dvc repro
----

TIP: Check the automatically generated data schema in `data/schema.edn`. Does it look correct?
If not, see the section below on editing the schema generation.

Go to `qc/app/qc-dashboard.html` and open it with a web browser to check the quality.

You can improve the default models by further editing the `params.yaml` file.
See our xref:auto-modeling::auto-modeling.adoc[section on automated data
modeling].

TIP: Add columns you are particularly interested in to the `columns` section for quality control (see commented out example in the `params.yaml` file). That way, you can ensure that the model captures exactly what you care about.

If not, see the section below on editing the schema generation.

== Query the model

There are different ways to query automatically built models from Python,
Clojure and JavaScript. The easiest way to query models is via an https://observablehq.com/[Observable noteook]: Type the following and follow instructions:
[source,bash]
----
query
